| EMODnet Human Activities, Cultural Heritage, Ship wrecks - Heritage Ship Wrecks | The dataset combines data collected from several sources: data collected and processed by the “Service hydrographique et océanographique de la marine” (SHOM) under the product “Wrecks and obstructions” for France (Hexagone and outermost regions and territories), The National Monument Service Wreck Viewer for Ireland, Historic England and the University of Oxford - The Oxford Roman Economy Project (Strauss, J. (2013). Shipwrecks Database. Version 1.0. Accessed (date): oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/shipwrecks_database/) for archeological remains of ship wrecks in the Mediterranean. | |
| Marine Heritage Shiprecks Database       | Dataset contains information regarding shipwrecks in waters off Nova Scotia including wreck name, date and type of event, and approximate location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Includes a data dictionary                                                                                       |
| NJ Maritime Museum’s Shipwreck Data Base | Data base focuses on maritime events that occurred in the waters along the New Jersey coast, primarily the Atlantic Ocean, Delaware Bay and Delaware River. The information contained in this data base was collected from a vast number of sources including newspaper archives, ship’s logs, diaries, USLSS annual reports, shipwreck books, periodicals and many web sites on the internet. Where there was conflicting information, the most frequent or most logical choice was used.                                                                   |                                                                                                                  |
| NJ Unidentified Shipwreck Data Base | A subset of the NJ Maritime Museum’s Shipwreck Data BaseA that contains a list of all the wrecks whose locations are known but whose identity are currently unknown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                  |
| Wrecks and Obstructions in AWOIS | The Wrecks and Obstruction database originally published through the Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (currently inaccessible) contains information on the identified submerged shipwrecks and obstructions within the U.S. maritime boundaries. The data includes the position of each feature (latitude and longitude) along with a brief description. Information to populate the database comes from what is currently available on the electronic navigational chart (ENC) and Coast Survey's Automated Wrecks and Obstructions Information System (AWOIS) database.



## Initialize Pipeline
To initiate the pipeline, two actions must occur:
1. A source csv file associated with each dataset listed above is copied to the data/input/verbatim folder. The datasets located in the sources folders are preserved in their verbatim form and should not be edited.
2. The name of the CSV file copied to the data/input folder is appended to the datasets list in the global.py file.
3. Once set, run the remapped utility
